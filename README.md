<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Mule is an intelligent delivery system that enables people to act as delivery units in exchange for incentivized benefits. By offering a peer to peer delivery service, Mule ensures seamless communication across multiple entities.

Through our app we connect our users to “Mules” (Deliverers), who deliver a requested commodity from establishments close to them for an incentive which is chosen by both the mule and the user. Loaded with all the tools necessary to ensure a satisfying consumer experience, Mule has an active payment gateway, a chat portal to stay connected with the mules and a bidding system which ensures both parties can agree on a price.

We hope to create a world where delivery isn’t a hassle but an opportunity, an opportunity for the people to earn as well as leverage the resources they have to the best of their ability.

To better understand our concept, please watch our concept video:
