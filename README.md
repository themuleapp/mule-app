# Mule

Mule is an intelligent delivery system that enables people to act as delivery units in
exchange for incentivized benefits. By offering a peer to peer delivery service,
Mule ensures seamless communication across multiple entities.

Through our app we connect our users to “Mules” (Deliverers), who deliver a
requested commodity from establishments close to them for an incentive which is
chosen by both the mule and the user. Loaded with all the tools necessary to ensure
a satisfying consumer experience, Mule has an active payment gateway, a chat
portal to stay connected with the mules and a bidding system which ensures both
parties can agree on a price.

We hope to create a world where delivery isn’t a hassle but an opportunity, an
opportunity for the people to earn as well as leverage the resources they have to the
best of their ability.

### How does Mule work?

Mule is a technology platform. Our smartphone apps connect delivery-partners and
requesters.

In universities where Mule operates, use your requester app to look up how many
mules (delivery-partners) are at or around a place that you wish to get something
from. Then, request a mule from that place.

Use your app to enter your preferred destination anytime before placing the
request. When a delivery-partner that is at or around the location you are
requesting from accepts your request, your app displays an estimated time of
arrival for the delivery-partner heading to the order pickup location.

Your app also provides info about the delivery-partner that will deliver the
requested item(s) including first name, ratings and contact information. Use your
app to communicate with the delivery-partner for order specifics via chat or call.
You can also track the delivery-partner in real-time to coordinate the delivery. This
info helps the two of you connect at the destination.

When you have received your items, your transaction is complete. The delivery fee
is automatically calculated and charged to the payment method you’ve linked to
your Mule account.

Mule also allows you to pay via Venmo, PayPal, Apple Pay and Google Pay.
These option must be selected before you request a ride.

Immediately after you have received the delivery, your app will ask you to rate
your deliverer from 1 to 5 Stars. Delivery-partners are also asked to rate users.
Mule’s feedback system is designed to foster a community of respect and
accountability for everyone.
